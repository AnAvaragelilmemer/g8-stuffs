## Abbreviations for measurements
<sub>Expect this as 1-15 for the test</sub>
Volume or Capacity | Volume | Weight |
------------------ | ------ | -----  | 
Teaspoon: t. or tsp | Mililiter: mL | Microgram: ug
Tablespoon: T. or tbsp | Liter: L | Miligram: mg
Fluid Ounce: fl. oz. | | gram: g
Cup: c or C | | kilogram: kg
pint: pt | |
quart: qt | |
gallon: gal | |
pound: lb. | |

## Temperature Measurement and Conversion
<sub>To find fahrenheit and celcius, pero can u find who asked?</sub>
- To find Fahrenheit:

$$\[F = \left( C \times 1.8 \right) + 32\]$$

- To find Celsius:

$$\[C = \left( F - 32 \right) \times 0.56\]$$

## Interpreting a Layout Plan
<sub>A *layout plan* is a scaled diagram of a room or building viewed from above.</sub>

### Layout plan symbols

### Interpretation of Layout Plan for Food Processing
- **Manual Drafting** - is used to draw a layout plan using traditional drafting tools
- **Computer-Aided Design (CAD)** - has the ability to produce accurate designs and can be created in 2-d and 3-d, although its expensive.
- **Freehand Drawing** - is a drawing made without the use of drawing instruments.

Kinds of Lines | Direction of Strokes
-------------- | --------------------
Horizontal Lines | are drawn from left to right if right handed, is drawn from right to left if left handed
Vertical Lines | strokes are drawn downward.
Curved Lines | are drawn downwards to either left or right.
Inclined to the right | are drawn downward
Inclined to left | are drawn downward

- **Linear Flow** is applied for safety of operation, workers or staff.
- **Heavy Lines** represents partitions of each section in plant.
- **Gaps** between the lines are used to represent the doors.
- **Two Block Arrows** are directional symbols used to represent the entrance of the plant.
- **Three Block Circles** are used to represent cauldrons.

## Performing Outer Packaging Procedures
<sub>"OY OY OY. BAKA!"</sub>
- **Food packaging** maintains the quality and safety of the product.
### Types of Packaging Material
- **Glass containers** can be recycled endlessly without loss in quality.
- **Metal** can Withstand high food processing temperatures.
    1. **Aluminum** is a lightweight and silvery white material. It is commonly used for making cans, foils.
    2. **Laminates** and **Metalized Flims** are used as food pouches
    3. **Tin plate** is used for packaged canned goods.
    4. **Aluminum Foil** is a paper-thin, shiny sheet of aluminum metal.
- **Plastic** is made from lightweight material. It is a flexible food packaging material.
- **Paper and paperboard.** are paper-based materials that come in different grades.
### Label of Packaged Processed Food According to quality control standards
<sub>please let this be true or false.</sub>
- **Product Name** shall specify and indicate the true nature of the food.

---

- **Biological Hazards** are generated by disease-causing microorganisms that include:
  -
      - **Bacteria** are single-celled microorganisms.

      - **Pathogenic Bacteria** When consumed, can cause illness like salmonella.
  -
      - **Parasites** are tiny organisms from a living host.
  -
      - **Viruses** are the smallest known forms of life that can invade the cells of the host.
  -
      - **Fungi** can be ound in soil, air, and water.
  
  
- **Chemical Hazards** Includes Cleaning agents, Pesticides, and other toxic metals.
- **Physical Hazards** Include food objects that find their way into food.

### Sanitary Practices in Food Safety

- **RA 10611** is the food safety act of 2013.

### Different food safety regulatory agencies.
- **Bureau of Animal Industry** (BAI)
- **National Dairy Authority** (NDA)
- **National Meat Inspection for service** (NMIS)
- **Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources** (BFAR)
- **Bureau of Plant Industry** (BPI)
- **Fertilizer and Pesticide Authority** (FPA)
- **Philippine Coconut Authority** (PCA)
- **Sugar Regulatory Administraion** (SRA)
- **National Food Authority** (NFA)
### Practices in Manufacturing Good Food
- **Good Manufacturing Practices** (GMP)

am not writing allat, go to page 57.

### First Aid & Fire Safety
- It is essential to act appropriately in the event of an injury or emergency, a *First aid* is given to prevent injury from getting worst.

## Participating in improving envinmental practices at work
<sub>Almost there.</sub>

- **Air Pollution** : you def know this lol, this is any substance in the atmosphere that has damaging effects.
- **Noise Pollution** : you also def know this, This is an excessive amount of noise or unpleasant sound.
- **Water Pollution** : The two type of water source are surface water and groundwater
