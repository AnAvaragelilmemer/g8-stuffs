## Abbreviations for measurements
<sub>Expect this as 1-15 for the test</sub>
Volume or Capacity | Volume | Weight |
------------------ | ------ | -----  | 
Teaspoon: t. or tsp | Mililiter: mL | Microgram: ug
Tablespoon: T. or tbsp | Liter: L | Miligram: mg
Fluid Ounce: fl. oz. | | gram: g

## Temperature Measurement and Conversion
<sub>To find fahrenheit and celcius, pero can u find who asked?</sub>
- To find Fahrenheit:

$$\[F = \left( C \times 1.8 \right) + 32\]$$

- To find Celsius:

$$\[C = \left( F - 32 \right) \times 0.56\]$$

## Interpreting a Layout Plan
<sub>A *layout plan* is a scaled diagram of a room or building viewed from above.</sub>

### Interpretation of Layout Plan for Food Processing
- **Manual Drafting** - is used to draw a layout plan using traditional drafting tools
- **Computer-Aided Design (CAD)** - has the ability to produce accurate designs and can be created in 2-d and 3-d, although its expensive.
- **Freehand Drawing** - is a drawing made without the use of drawing instruments.

Kinds of Lines | Direction of Strokes
-------------- | --------------------
Horizontal Lines | are drawn from left to right if right handed, is drawn from right to left if left handed
Vertical Lines | strokes are drawn downward.
Curved Lines | are drawn downwards to either left or right.
Inclined to the right | are drawn downward
Inclined to left | are drawn downward

- **Linear Flow** is applied for safety of operation, workers or staff.
- **Heavy Lines** represents partitions of each section in plant.
- **Gaps** between the lines are used to represent the doors.
- **Two Block Arrows** are directional symbols used to represent the entrance of the plant.
- **Three Block Circles** are used to represent cauldrons.

## Performing Outer Packaging Procedures
<sub>"OY OY OY. BAKA!"</sub>
- **Food packaging** maintains the quality and safety of the product.
### Types of Packaging Material
- **Glass containers** can be recycled endlessly without loss in quality.
- **Metal** can Withstand high food processing temperatures.
    1. **Aluminum** is a lightweight and silvery white material. It is commonly used for making cans, foils.
    2. **Laminates** and **Metalized Flims** are used as food pouches
    3. **Tin plate** is used for packaged canned goods.
    4. **Aluminum Foil** is a paper-thin, shiny sheet of aluminum metal.
- **Plastic** is made from lightweight material. It is a flexible food packaging material.
- **Paper and paperboard.** are paper-based materials that come in different grades.
### Label of Packaged Processed Food According to quality control standards
